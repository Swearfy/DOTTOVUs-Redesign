# DOTTOVUs-Redesign

## Case study

Dottovu is a well known voice actor, stumbled across their website from the main twitter account and to put it simply was not that well done. So i tought what if as one of my side projects i create a redesign of their website in my own time.

## Technologies and needs

I have yet to decide what i will be using but the website needs to be mobile first, have a better navigation , be a proper showcase website.

Main website is hosted and created on wix so it is needed to have ease of integration / compatibility

- [Penpot](https://penpot.app/) or [Lunacy](https://icons8.com/lunacy) for the wireframe + design
- React/ mby worth trying vue but wix integration affects this
- Tailwindcss
